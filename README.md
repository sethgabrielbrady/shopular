# Shopular
## Seth Brady
### Front End 03/27/17


### Set Up

1. clone from github
2. open in server


This is practice with the basics of ``Angular`` building a ``web application``
for a shop's inventory. At the end of this project I should have a basic
grasp of putting a couple of the pieces of ``Angular`` together to see data in
our browser.


### Technology Used
bootstrap, sass, angular, git,

### Current Build
The current build displays data in the form of a table on the view. Currently the data
is an array of objects held inside the controller.js file. Each object contains
id, name, price, quantity, color, and discount properties. On the page is a button
that when clicked will change the price to British Pounds, the item "waste basket"
to "rubbish bin", and the word color to "colour", which is located in the
table title.

### TODO
Even though the current build will only allow for 1 click event to change, Id like
make it a toggle so that it can return to the original US dollars, text, naming.
